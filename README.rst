These logos were drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format [2] for RAC by
Tyler Tidman VA3DGN.  Wherever possible, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
format [3] is now being used for all auto-generated bitmaps.  The chosen fonts,
"DejaVu Sans Bold" and "DejaVu Sans" [4] are provided gratis under a free
license.

Software that was used to create and work with these files:
  - GNU Make (3.81) [5]
  - Inkscape (0.48.3.1, 0.48, 0.47, 0.46) [6]
  - Imagemagick (6.7.7-10, 6.6.0-4, 6.3.7) [7]
  - Debian Linux (7,3, 7.0, 6.0) [8]

Type "make" to magically generate bitmap versions from the source vector .svg
files.
